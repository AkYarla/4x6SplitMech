# 4x6SplitMech
[INPROGRESS]

*First Custom Keeb Project/Build*



This Project is based off of the PCB design of jacekplonowski's 4x6 Split PCB. Only dimnesional modifications added. 


(His project is under a GNU General Public License [V3, 29th June 2007]  )



Parts-List:
* The PCB's
* Bottom Layer, Plate, and Cover
* 48 MX based Switches (Choc and Alps also supported)
* 48 1N14184 Diodes
* 48 1/8W 470 立 resistors
* Optional : 48 3mm LED's (In-switch only)
* 1 100k 立 resistor
* 1 100 立 resistor
* (2-4) 4.7k 立 resistors
* 1 2N7000 mosfet
* 2 Controllers (Pro-micro family / Elite-C)
* 2 TRRS (PJ-320A) Jacks
* 2 Reset switches
* 6/9mm M2 Brass standoffs
* 5mm M2 Screws



Notes:
* PCB is flipable (based on Corne), only thru-hole components (3mm Leds).
* 4x6 40% Ortholinear + columnar stagger. 
* * Uses 1u and 1.25 u Keycaps
* Left side controller is soldered front side up, right side controller is soldered bottom side up
* Controllers, TRRS jacks, resistors, and mofset are all top-mounted
* Kerf of plate files (In original github) set to 0.15mm (typical for Ponoko/Laserboost/Lasergist)
